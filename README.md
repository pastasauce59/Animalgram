# Animalgram 🐈 🐕 🙉 🐄 🦒
Animalgram is exactly how it sounds, it's like instagram… except for animals! A "live" feed of posts featuring all types of animals that can be liked, commented on, and favorited. The search bar allows posts of animals to be searched via a specific animal type. Currently there is no login feature and the app starts up as if a user is already "logged in" and is a proof of concept of features available to a user of this app. Animalgram is a full CRUD app, allowing a user to create a post, delete a post, update a post (via comments, likes, favorites) and delete a post. The navigation bar features a "Cat" feed, another proof of concept that a user can tune into specific content via a specialzed feed filter. "Favorites" would be specific to a user and posts they personally have favorited.
